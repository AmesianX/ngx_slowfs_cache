2012-02-28    VERSION 1.7
    * Fix on-disk cache size calculation.
      Since the initial release, recorded on-disk cache size was
      decreased twice for purged content (once during cache purge
      and once during subsequent cache update).
      This resulted in recorded on-disk cache size being much
      smaller than in reality, which could lead to on-disk cache
      outgrowing defined "max_size" parameter.
      Patch from Pyry Hakulinen (via ngx_cache_purge, months ago).

    * Append path of the file being cached to the slowfs process
      title.

2011-05-03    VERSION 1.6
    * Fix compatibility with nginx-1.0.1.
      Reported by Sergey A. Osokin.

2011-04-21
    * Stop doing sanity checks when module isn't enabled.
      Reported by Tobi Tamas.

      Patch from Sergey A. Osokin.

2010-01-18    VERSION 1.3

      Reported by Serhan Sevim.
